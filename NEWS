* Changes in 0.0.3 (since 0.0.2)

The =search-est= operation now supports attribute filtering.

The operation =get-bug-message-numbers= has been added.

The procedure =fetch-mbox= has been added to =(debbugs operations)=.

The procedure =soap-invoke*= has been added, which calls =soap-invoke=
and caches the results.

The =(debbugs soap)= module overrides Guile’s default handler for
Content-Type headers to avoid errors when processing multipart
messages with boundary strings containing “=”.

The =soap-invoke= procedure now accepts a procedure returning the usable Debbugs endpoint URLs in addition to a plain service URL string as previously.

The =(debbugs)= module provides the =%debian= and =%gnu= variables for
the two major Debbugs instances out there.  They can be used as the
first argument to =soap-invoke=.  The module also re-exports all
public definitions of the =bug=, =operations=, and =soap= modules.

Use guile-email instead of poorly parsing emails on our own.

* First release as part of GNU: 0.0.2

On January 15, 2018 Guile Debbugs joined the GNU Project.

* Initial release 0.0.1

This is the first public release of Guile Debbugs.  Enjoy!
