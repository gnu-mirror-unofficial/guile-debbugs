This is an attempt to provide Guile bindings for the debbugs bug
tracker.  See the Info manual (=doc/guile-debbugs.info=) for examples
and documentation.  (You will have to build it first.)

* Missing features

+ TLS support (required for GNU debbugs instance)
+ convenience procedures for =<bug>= records (e.g. =bug-done?=)
+ monadic interface

* Hacking

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
guix environment --ad-hoc autoconf automake texinfo pkg-config guile@2.2
./bootstrap.sh
./configure
make
#+END_SRC

* License

Guile-Debbugs is released under the GNU General Public License version
3 or, at your option, any later version.  You are welcome to using it
in a web application under the Affero GPL version 3 or later.
