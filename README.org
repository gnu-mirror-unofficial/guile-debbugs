* What is this?

This is an attempt to provide Guile bindings for the debbugs bug
tracker.  See the Info manual (=doc/guile-debbugs.info=) for examples
and documentation.  (You will have to build it first.)

* Missing features

+ convenience procedures for =<bug>= records (e.g. =bug-done?=)
+ monadic interface

* Known problems

+ Guile 2.2.2 has a bug in “(web client)”, which prevents HTTPS connections from being established.  This was fixed with commit =0c102b56e98da39b5a3213bdc567a31ad8ef3e73= but as of the time of this writing there has not been a release including the fix.

* Hacking

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
guix environment --ad-hoc autoconf automake make texinfo pkg-config guile@2.2
./bootstrap.sh
./configure
make
#+END_SRC
